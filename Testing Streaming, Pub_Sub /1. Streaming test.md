To test Redis streaming with two consumers, you can use the Redis CLI or a programming language like Python. Below, I'll guide you through testing Redis streams using the Redis CLI and then using Python.

### 1. **Using Redis CLI**

#### Step 1: Start Redis Server
Ensure your Redis server is running:
```bash
sudo systemctl start redis
```

#### Step 2: Open Redis CLI
Open the Redis CLI in your terminal:
```bash
redis-cli
```

#### Step 3: Create a Stream and Add Messages
In the Redis CLI, create a stream and add a message:
```bash
XADD mystream * message "Hello, World!"
```
This will return an ID for the message (e.g., `1640995200000-0`).

#### Step 4: Create Two Consumers
Open two separate terminal windows to simulate two consumers.

- **Consumer 1**:
  ```bash
  redis-cli
  XREAD BLOCK 0 STREAMS mystream $
  ```
  This will block and wait for new messages.

- **Consumer 2**:
  ```bash
  redis-cli
  XREAD BLOCK 0 STREAMS mystream $
  ```
  This will also block and wait for new messages.

#### Step 5: Send a New Message
In the Redis CLI, send another message:
```bash
XADD mystream * message "This is a test message"
```

Both consumers should receive the new message.

### 2. **Using Python**

If you prefer to use Python, you can use the `redis-py` library to create a producer and two consumers.

#### Step 1: Install `redis-py`
Install the Redis Python library:
```bash
pip install redis
```

#### Step 2: Create a Producer Script
Create a Python script (`producer.py`) to produce messages:
```python
import redis

# Connect to Redis
r = redis.Redis(host='localhost', port=6379, db=0)

# Add a message to the stream
r.xadd('mystream', {'message': 'Hello, World!'})
print("Message sent to stream.")
```

#### Step 3: Create a Consumer Script
Create a Python script (`consumer.py`) to consume messages:
```python
import redis

# Connect to Redis
r = redis.Redis(host='localhost', port=6379, db=0)

# Consumer group and name
group_name = 'mygroup'
consumer_name = 'consumer1'  # Change to 'consumer2' for the second consumer

# Create a consumer group (if it doesn't exist)
try:
    r.xgroup_create('mystream', group_name, id='0', mkstream=True)
except redis.exceptions.ResponseError as e:
    print(f"Group already exists: {e}")

# Read messages from the stream
while True:
    messages = r.xreadgroup(group_name, consumer_name, {'mystream': '>'}, count=1, block=0)
    for stream, message_list in messages:
        for message_id, message in message_list:
            print(f"Consumer {consumer_name} received message: {message}")
```

#### Step 4: Run the Scripts
- Open three terminal windows.
- In the first terminal, run the producer script:
  ```bash
  python3 producer.py
  ```
- In the second terminal, run the first consumer:
  ```bash
  python3 consumer.py
  ```
- In the third terminal, run the second consumer (modify the `consumer_name` to `consumer2` in the script):
  ```bash
  python3 consumer.py
  ```

#### Step 5: Test
Run the producer script again to send a new message. Both consumers should receive the message.

### 3. **Using Browser (Optional)**
If you want to test Redis streams in a browser, you can use a web framework like Flask or Django to create an API that interacts with Redis. However, this requires more setup and is not as straightforward as using the CLI or Python scripts.
